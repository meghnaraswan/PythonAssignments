Assignment 6

variance.py

N/A

I used the past python programs we had done in class as a reference for this assignment, such as the calling_functions.py and the mutable_params.py program. I also used the sum.py program we did in class as a reference to how to keep prompting the user for a positive integer until they in input a negative value.
