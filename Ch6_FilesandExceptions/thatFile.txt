Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.

Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,

Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
Out of myself, press me to death with wit.

Which is as bad as die with tickling.

Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:

And every lovely organ of her life

Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.
We will not fail.
To-night I'll mourn with Hero.

Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET, meeting
Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at

Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.
And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,

woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give

pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.
Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
And therefore will come.


That sits above,
How pitiful I deserve,--

Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
It appears not in this confession: there's not one

Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old

fed and gone. Will you come presently?
Will you go hear this news, signior?
I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
thee to thy uncle's.

Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and three or four with tapers
Is this the monument of Leonato?
It is, my lord.

Round about her tomb they go.
Help us to sigh and groan,

Heavily, heavily.
Now, unto thy bones good night!

To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.
Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,
And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.

To visit me. You know your office, brother:
And give her to young Claudio.
Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.
Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.
To do what, signior?
To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.
That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.
And I do with an eye of love requite her.
The sight whereof I think you had from me,

Here comes the prince and Claudio.

Good morrow to this fair assembly.
Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:
To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?
I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.
Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.

Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?
I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
When he would play the noble beast in love.
Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;
And got a calf in that same noble feat

Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked
Which is the lady I must seize upon?
This same is she, and I do give you her.
Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.
No, that you shall not, till you take her hand

And when I lived, I was your other wife:
