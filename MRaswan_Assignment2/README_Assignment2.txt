Assignment 2

Quadratic2.py
TotalPrice2.py

Initially, for the Quadratic2.py program, I kept getting the "math domain error" using the if statements, because the program would run through the quadratic function before the if statement. Then I realized that I had to add the function within the if statement, allowing the if/else statement to run before executing either the roots or informing the user that the roots do not exist. 

I used the lunch.py and suitcase.py programs we did in class for control conditionals as reference to how to write an if/else statement for the Quadratic.py and TotalPrice.py programs.
