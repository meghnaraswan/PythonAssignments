I haven't been able to figure out why if the user inputs an invalid input with either punctuation or numbers, that it won't say "what you wrote was invalid", and then prompt the user to write alpha characters only. Instead, my code just prompts the user without notifying them that what they previously wrote was invalid.

I asked Kylie for help for when the the length of the first and last word is the same in the construct part of the code on lines 111-114.
